# ID311-Linjar-Arduino-Code

Used Arduino IDE to write and upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

Key functionalities implemented:

Display real-time clock on the TFT screen using the Adafruit GFX and ILI9341 libraries.

Pomodoro timer logic with adjustable intervals (e.g., 25 minutes work, 5 minutes break).

Buzzer feedback for timer completion.

Button functionality for user interaction (start, pause, reset).

Debugging and testing the code iteratively to ensure smooth operation of all features.
